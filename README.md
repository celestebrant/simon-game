# Simon Game
How to play
1. Navigate to [the Simon Game](https://celestebrant.github.io/simon-game/)
1. Press any key to start the game.
1. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same coloured button.
1. Simon will give a new signal. Repeat the first followed by the new signal.
1. The sequence of signals that Simon will build on will grow and your goal is to try to reproduce the signal sequence perfectly.
1. Press any wrong button, and it's GAME OVER!
